Chatting with us
=========================================
We also recommend you connect to our IRC network so you can chat to our
members a bit and get to know them. :D

Find out more at: http://uwcs.co.uk/cms/about/services/irc/


Web Hosting
=========================================
If you're interested in hosting, you'll want to go to http://uwcs.co.uk/member/
and fill in the request form for a shell account. You'll need to make a separate
request for database account (a MySQL account) if any of your sites use that (for
example WordPress).


Further Info
=========================================
If you have any other questions, http://uwcs.co.uk/cms/about/faq/ is a good place to
start, and you can always drop us a line at compsoc-exec@uwcs.co.uk.

Regards,
